# car_price_prediction
Predicting car prices using regression with feature engineering. Topics covered in this project include:
*Creating a regression model from scratch (that is, direct application of linear algebra, not using built-in regression functions)
*Exploratory data analysis
*Setting up and implementing a validation framework
*Performing basic feature engineering
*Controlling model through regularization
*Using the model to predict car prices
