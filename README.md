# car_price_prediction
Predicting car prices using regression with feature engineering. Topics covered in this project include: <br>
* Creating a regression model from scratch (that is, direct application of linear algebra, not using built-in regression functions) <br>
* Exploratory data analysis <br>
* Setting up and implementing a validation framework <br>
* Performing basic feature engineering <br>
* Controlling model through regularization <br>
* Using the model to predict car prices <br>

A second version of this project is implemented using Scikit-learn.
