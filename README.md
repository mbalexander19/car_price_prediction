# car_price_prediction
Predicting car prices using regression with feature engineering. Topics covered in this project include: <br>
* Creating a regression model from scratch (that is, direct application of linear algebra, not using built-in regression functions) <br>
* Exploratory data analysis <br>
* Setting up and implementing a validation framework <br>
* Performing basic feature engineering <br>
* Controlling model through regularization <br>
* Using the model to predict car prices <br>

The [original project](https://github.com/mbalexander19/car_price_prediction/blob/main/chapter-02-car-price-project.ipynb) implements feature engineering and linear regression from scratch. A [second version](https://github.com/mbalexander19/car_price_prediction/blob/main/car-price-project-sklearn.ipynb) of this project is implemented using Scikit-learn.
